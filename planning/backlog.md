## Must Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

- **Home Page**
- As a junior developer I want to have a demo version to be sure that the
  platform meets all project requirements
- [x] _The user should be able to receive a demo version of the site to his
      email address_
- As a junior developer I want to know how to install Loruki
- [x] _There should be a terminal command on how to install Loruki_
- As a junior developer I want to know what languages are supported by Loruki so
  I can use them for my work
- [x] _Clearly shows all the supported languages on the home-page_
