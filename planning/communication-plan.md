## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

    0 -> 30 min: Try on your own
    30 -> 60 min: Ask your group for help
    60+ min: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
