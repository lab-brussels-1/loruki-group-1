Collaboration than on the final result.

- Apply agile strategy
- Create issues with clear and helpful labels, milestones for all things in the
  Project scope so we can track our progress
- Review PRs before merging
- Encourage each team members to put their problems in discussion forum than one
  to one messaging
- Conduct Team meeting as per the schedule. -Send Meeting Agenda before meeting
  and inform team members about 'minutes of meeting' after the discussion.

## Start Doing

- As a team, work on different tasks simultaneously to get result faster instead
  of waiting for the end of previous task.
- First priority to complete the work assigned by the team and then try to help
  other team members.

## Lessons Learned
