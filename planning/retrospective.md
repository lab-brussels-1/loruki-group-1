# Retrospective

The LORUKI website rebuilt project our team focused more on Planning and
Collaboration than on the final result.

<!--Maria's suggestion:-->

"...our team focused more on Planning and Collaboration than on code change"

## Stop Doing

- Overthinking about "How to help other team member to solve her issues"
- Fine tune other's work
- Try to do each step perfectly
  <!--Maria's suggestion:-->
- Not asking for help when get stuck
    <!--zerubabel's suggestion:-->
  -asking for help b/c i tried it on the previous project and it did't go well

## Continue Doing

- Collaborate with a team during the project
- Apply agile strategy
- Create issues with clear and helpful labels, milestones for all things in the
  Project scope so we can track our progress
- Review PRs before merging
- Encourage each team members to put their problems in discussion forum than one
  to one messaging
- Conduct Team meeting as per the schedule
- Send Meeting Agenda before meeting and inform team members about 'minutes of
meeting' after the discussion.
  <!--zerubabel's suggestion:-->
- telling teammates every step and change before pushing PR

## Start Doing

- As a team, work on different tasks simultaneously to get result faster instead
  of waiting for the end of previous task.
- First priority to complete the work assigned by the team and then try to help
  other team members.

## Lessons Learned

- done better than perfect
- don't commit directly to master branch
<!--Maria's suggestions-->
- use a new branch for every new task
- don't push directly to master

---

## Strategy vs. Board

- we have created issues with helpful labels and milestones for all must have
  user stories in our Development strategy.
- we have changed wireframe due to updated development plan
- our Project board reflects our Strategy

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

-Header -Showcase(Form and logo) -Main info -Footer

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

<!--Maria's suggestions-->

Misunderstanding among team about some task

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

<!--Maria's suggestions-->

I would make the logo (Loruki name) responsive on mobile screens, now it's not.
May be I would add photos for User Personas in the planning folder. I wouldn't
add anything else since I think we have already achieved the goal of the
project.

### Or remove extra steps?

No
